            Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a very well regarded film, not only for its impressive writing and
            story telling, but for how it changed and influenced the animation industry.
            Sony Picture Aniamtions is an animation studio owned by Sony and one that is known for producing good
            animated films such as: Open Season, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Hotel Transylvania and many more.
            All of which are good and entertaining films were pretty generic and standard in terms of animation and
            design.
            This changed with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 2018, the design and asthetic of the film was very
            different
            from that of previous animated movies. It felt like a comic book, it had hand drawn asthetics and will still
            clearing a 3D aniamted film the design of the film looked so different from previous movies and it fit the
            superhero asthetic so well that Sony had a huge success. Following this success in 2021 Sony Picture
            Animations relased another film called The Mitchells Vs. The Machines. This movie also combined these 2D,
            comic-book hand drawn asthetics that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. This movie was recieved also
            well and even won Oustanding Achhievement in Animated Film from the SCAD Film Festival in 2021. This
            asthetic that Into the Spider-Verse had was proving to be a hit and something people wanted, and Across The
            Spider-Verse is no different.

            Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse built off of what was establish and created with Spider-Man: Into the
            Spider-Verse and ran with it. This movie features even more crazy animation technics and sytle choices, the
            editing the opposing styles it all culminatives into one film that changed the standard idea of a animated
            film. This movie features so many different Spider-People from different dimensions and because of this it
            allowed the animator to have fun with different styles and asthetic, because now they didnt all have to be
            cohesive. It made narrative sense for the characters to be draw, animated, and designed differently.
            This mixture of 2D elements and 3D elements as well as differently animated and designed characters which
            sound like it would be jarring and hard to look at was done so well that it created a harmony in the film.
            Mixing hand drawn or comic book style technics into a 3D animated film has proven to be successful and
            something that other films have adapted.

            As mentioned before The Mitchells versus the Machines was clearly influenced by the Into the Spider-Verse
            athetic but there are other films as well. The newest Puss in Boots film, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,
            which came out in 2022 by DreamWorks, has some clear influences from Spider-Man, from the painting like
            design on the fur and the animation style in general with its comic-book style speed lines and fighting
            animations. The Bad Guys which also came out in 2022, also has design choices that seem to have been
            inspired by Into the Spider-Verse. Most recently in 2023 New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, is
            the most like the Spider-Verse films, both being based of comics it makes sense that this asthetic would
            work
            the best for it. Now its important to note I am not saying this movies stole from Spider-Verse or that
            Spider-Verse is the only animated movie to do this style and is perfect. What I am saying however is there
            is
            clearly a tend in
            the industry following the Spider-Verse films with the design of hand drawn, comic-book like design, and as
            someone who enjoys this design and thinks its time for 3D animated films to look different from the generic
            Pixar releastic renderings and a fan of classic 2D animation I am all for this trend in the industry.
