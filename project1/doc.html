  <h2>Goal of website</h2>
  <p>
    My goal for this website was to create a film review/ animation blog post.<br> I wanted to
    emulate a traditional review page from a website like Polygon or IGN, but covering an animated movie
    rather than a video game.<br> The users of this website would most likely be people are intrested in animation.
    <br>Similarly to how people who read IGN or Polygon are people who are in the sphere of video games. <br>This is
    targeted
    towards people who are either in the world of animtion or
    simply just enjoy the media.
  </p>
  <h2> Additional Notes</h2>
  <p> I am happy with how the website came out. There are a few things I would change, such as adding the ability to
    <br>
    close the menu on mobile rather than it just being open. I would also change how the navbar scrolls down. Adding a
    <br>
    top bar that moves with it
    and pushes the text along it so as to make it cleaner.<br> I would also reformat some of the text to be less big
    chunks
