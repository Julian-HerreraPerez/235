      <p class="Bio">
        My name is Julian Herrera Perez, I am a second year Game Development and
        Design student at Rochester Institute of Technology (<abbr>RIT</abbr>).
        I hope that through this class I am able to develop my skills in HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript, so that I can use them in my personal and
        professional projects. Some of my hobbies include, playing video and
        board games, reading, making art and other crafts, and programing. Im
        not sure where I want to be where when I graduate, I just take the days
        one step at a time and go with the flow.
